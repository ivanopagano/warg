warg
====

NB - This is just brief concept definitions.


1) What ?

warg is thought to be an aid for developing role playing games, without troubling oneself much with backend development, thus allowing to spend more time on graphics, sounds or any other assets of game. It's initial goal is provide a set of highly customizable modules, generalizing setting of the game, it's mechanics, world and interaction with player. 

It will try to unite and automate most common in-game tasks like handling most of game calculations (i.e. damage formulas, experience, etc.), tracking state of player progress, define interactive objects, issuing global events, handling social interactions and many more.

The potential complexity of such platform is enermous and is limited only by human imagination. In that regard a small scope of functionality should be defined first, some kind of primary goal to achieve. So for version 0.0.0.1 :) it would be sufficient to achieve the following :

 - Define set of base/core interfaces for client-server interaction (that is player <-> world)
 - Implement basic tech. stack for API, DB and other integrations.
 - Implement a small console-based client-server interaction, similar to MUD.
 
For those goals, I plan to implement example of using warg - I will create a primitive CRPG, which would utilize a very basic concepts loosely inspired from DnD board games.

 - Character creation.
 - Monster generation.
 - Character - Monster interaction in simple form of combat.

2) Why ?

Mostly for fun :) I'm avid fan of everything CRPG/fantasy/sci-fi related, from Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms to Dune and Star Wars,this is my way of contribute something to these genres.

3) How ?

I started this project with a thought of learning functional/reactive programming paradigms. For now, Scala/Akka is my choice of tools - I know almost nothing about these, so it should be fun. I have over 10 years of experience in programming, particularly Java.

4) Can I contribute ?


Sure that's why this project is on GitHub :) Feel free to write - starub@gmail.com
