warg
====

NB - This is just brief concept definitions.


1) What ?

warg is thought to be an aid for developing role playing games, without troubling oneself much with backend development, thus allowing to spend more time on graphics, sounds or any other assets of game. It's initial goal is provide a set of highly customizable modules, defining setting of the game, it's mechanics, world and interaction with player. warg should be capable of handling most of game calculations (i.e. damage formulas, experience, etc.), tracking state of player progress, define interactive objects, issuing global events, handling social interactions and many more.

2) Why ?

Mostly for fun :) I'm avid fan of everything crpg/fantasy/sci-fi related, from Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms to Dune and Star Wars,this is my way of contribute something to these genres.

3) How ?

I started this project with a thought of learning functional/reactive programming paradigms. For now, Scala/Akka is my choice of tools - I know almost nothing about these, so it should be fun. I have over 10 years of experience in programming, particularly Java.

4) Can I contribute ?


Sure that's why this project is on GitHub :) Feel free to write - starub@gmail.com
